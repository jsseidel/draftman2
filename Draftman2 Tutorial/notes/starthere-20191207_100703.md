# Draftman2 Tutorial

Welcome to Draftman2. I created Draftman2 because I wasn't satisified with any of the long-form draft-management apps out there, especially when it came to Linux. My goal for Draftman2 is a minimalistic, yet powerful, tool for maintaining large writing projects.

Okay, enough of my yackin'. Let's boogie. You see that file up there? _Start Here_? Start the tutorial by opening that file. To open a Draftman2 file, you can:

1. Double-click in the row anywhere but the Name field (if you do _that_, you'll change the name of the file).
2. Right-click in the row and select _Edit..._
3. Select the row and select _Project->Edit..._ from the menu.

If you saw an error about your editor, it's because this tutorial defaults to using the Gnome text editor. In any case, let's change things to use your favorite markdown editor. To do that, choose _Project->Preferences..._ from the menu. Add your editor there at the top. If you're a KDE person, for example, you can use `/usr/bin/kate`. The only requirements are that the editor must be able to edit plain-text and/or Markdown and that it can open a file by providing one on the command line. You'll figure it out. When you do, close the dialog and/or file and try opening the _Start Here_ file again.

Aha! Success!
