# About Draftman2 notes

Every Draftman2 object, i.e. files and folders, has an associated note. Notes are Markdown files saved in the 'notes' directory inside Draftman2 projects.

Notes can be good for:

1. If you're a plotter, you can create a bunch of chapter folders and empty scenes and use the notes to keep track of what each scene or chapter is about.
2. As you're writing a scene, use the note to jot down problems or ideas you might think of.
3. Keeping editing notes as you read a scene or chapter.

Okay, enough about notes. Let's now try opening the 'About Draftman2' file. To do that, you can either:

1. Double click anywhere other than the Name column in a file's row.
2. Right click in a file's row and select 'Edit...'
3. Select a row and then select 'Project->Edit...' from the menu.
