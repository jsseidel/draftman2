Thanks for giving Draftman2 a try. I use Draftman2 for my own writing projects because I couldn't find an open-source organizational tool for long-form writing projects that suited my needs:

1.  Open source
2. Similar in nature to Scrivener but less of a black box and less heavy weight.
3. Notes per scene/chapter
4. The ability to use my own editor

Learning to use Draftman2 is easy. Just follow along in the tutorial.

Happy writing!
