# Compiling a Project

To assemble all the relevant files into a coherent single Markdown document, select "Compile..." from the Project menu and then choose a location to store the file.

Draftman2 will include all files marked as "Inc" from the Keeper.

## File titles

Note that you have the option of including file names as headers. Simply choose "Preferences..." from the Project menu and click the "Include file titles."

In this way, you can create Markdown files without headers and let Draftman2 put them in automatically during a compile at the correct heading level. For example, if you have a folder that contains a file named 'Foo,' Draftman2 will output '## Foo.'

Or, put them in yourself and Draftman2 will ignore the names you give the files in the Keeper when compiling.

## Folder titles

Similar to file titles, you can optionally include folder titles in the compiled output as well.
