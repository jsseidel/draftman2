# Tutorial

Nice work getting your editor up. In this little tutorial, we're going to create a tiny novel and publish it to a single markdown file.

## The application window

First, let's get a handle on what we're staring at here. As you can see, the Draftman2 app window is split into 2 panes. The top pane is called the Keeper. The bottom pane shows notes associated with items selected in the Keeper, both files and folders.

### The Keeper

The keeper consists of rows that represent items in your writing project, both files and folders. Folders can contain other folders and files. Files can contain other files. The Keeper is linear. Imagine your writing project as a single file. Items at the top of the Keeper represent things that would appear at the top of your file. Items at the bottom represent things that would appear at the end of the document.

Tip: If you create a new folder and name it 'Trash,' Draftman2 will give it a special trashcan icon. There is nothing special about the trashcan folder. It's simply a convenience, a place to copy stuff you don't quite have the guts to delete forever.

### Notes

Every item in Draftman2 has an associated notes file, which is displayed below the Keeper when you select an item. You don't need to save your notes. Draftman2 handles this automatically whenever you change your selection or click in the whitespace below the Keeper.

Notes provides only rudimentary text-editing capabilities, e.g. cut and paste, copying, etc., and remains internal to your project. It should obey all the usual keyboard shortcuts (e.g. Ctrl-x to cut, Ctrl-c to copy).

## Add a chapter

Now that we've got a good handle on the application window, let's create the beginning of your next novel.

First, add a folder to represent the first chapter to the root folder by:

1. Right-clicking in the whitespace below the Keeper rows (which should deselect
   any selected rows) and selecting _Add folder..._ from the popup  menu, or
2. Selecting _Add folder at root..._ from the _Project_ menu.

Type 'Chapter 1' into the dialog and click _OK_. Draftman2 created a new folder and automatically marked it to include in the compilation by checking the _Inc_ checkbox (short for Include).

## Add a scene to Chaper 1

Next, let's add a 'scene' to Chapter 1. Scenes, in Draftman2 parlance, indicate either a count of Markdown headers in a text file (i.e. lines that start with some number of `#` characters) or the file itself as a single scene.

To add a scene to Chaper 1:

1. Right-click on the Chaper 1 row and select _Add file..._ from the popup menu, or
2. Select the Chaper 1 row and then select _Add file..._ from the _Project_ menu, or
3. Right-click on the Chapter 1 row to select it and then select *Project->Add...* from the menu.

Type 'Scene 1' into the dialog and click _OK_. Draftman2 created a new file item inside the Chapter 1 folder. To see it, click the _Expand all_ button beneath the Keeper. You can also click the arrow next to the Chaper 1 folder icon.

### Editing Scene 1

To edit our new scene, open it by:

1. Right-clicking on the Scene 1 row and selecting _Edit..._ from the popup menu, or
2. Double-clicking anywhere in the Scene 1 row _except the Name field_. (If you double click the _Name_ field, you will rename the file. Go ahead and try it you want.), or
3. Right-clicking on the Scene 1 row to select it and then selecting *Project->Edit...* from the menu.

Paste this text into the scene using your editor, save, and close.

Pellentesque suscipit urna quam, a mollis lacus cursus quis. Duis eu dui vel odio cursus venenatis vitae id dui. Mauris facilisis diam vel orci pellentesque posuere. Donec aliquam rhoncus nisl sed malesuada. Cras vel suscipit eros. Sed laoreet imperdiet ipsum, eget volutpat massa maximus sit amet. Duis vulputate rutrum metus, a fringilla purus placerat at. Aliquam egestas pretium efficitur. 
```

### Updating the word and scene counts

Since we've edited a file outside of Draftman2, we need to update the word and scene counts in the Keeper. Do that by clicking the _Update counts_ button beneath the Keeper.

The scenes column tells you how many scenes are in a file or a folder represented by that row.  Because you might not use headers in a file, a file that contains no headers is counted as having one scene, even if it is empty.

The scene count next to a folder indicates the total number of scenes found within the folder. If you have a folder that contains five files with one scene per file, Scenes would be 5 at the folder row. If you open the folder, each file would show 1 scene at its row.

The Running column next to the Scenes column indicates how many *total* scenes that have been found *as of and including that row* for all included (Inc is checked) items above.

The word count works the same way, except Draftman2 counts words instead of scenes.

## Another chapter

Now, repeat this process to add another scene named 'Scene 2' to the Chaper 1 folder. After you've done that, repeat the same procedure for adding 'Chapter 2' and add 2 scenes to that.

Note: You'll have to click and drag the Chapter 2 folder so that it appears just above the 'Start Here' file. Alas, in GTK applications, this can be a bit fiddly. The trick is to pay careful attention to the lines that appear above, below, and surrounding items. If you see 2 lines surrounding an item while clicking and dragging a row, it means GTK will place the row inside what's surrounded.

## Compiling your project

Finally, we'll tell Draftman2 to compile our project into a single Markdown file, suitable for converting into a docx or whatever. 

Tip: `pandoc` is an excellent tool for converting Markdown to other formats.

First, make sure that in the Keeper, only 'Chapter 1' and 'Chapter 2' have the _Inc_ checked. This tells Draftman2 that it should only include these 2 chapters in the compilation output.

Now, open the _Preferences_ dialog (hint: _Project->Preferences..._ from the menu). Let's take a closer look at the _Compilation_ frame.

Make sure that _Include folder titles_ IS NOT checked and that _Include file titles_ IS checked.

Now, check the _Include text with files_ checkbox, add `* * *` in the text entry box, and check the _And skip first_ checkbox.

### Compilation options

_Include folder titles_: Draftman2 will output folder titles as Markdown headings (e.g. `# Folder title`). The heading level will match that of the folder, so if you have a folder inside a folder, it's title will have a heading level of '2' or `##`.

_Include file titles_: Similar to _Include folder titles_, Draftman2 will output an appropriate heading using the title of the file.

_Include text with files_: This option is for those users who use scene separators. When ticked, Draftman2 will output the given text before each file but _not as a heading_. Further, if you tick the _And skip first_ checkbox, Draftman2 will _not_ output a scene separator for the first file.

### Compile

Close the _Preferences_ dialog and select _Project->Compile..._ from the menu. Finally, choose a directory where Draftman2 should save the output. Here's what you'll see:
