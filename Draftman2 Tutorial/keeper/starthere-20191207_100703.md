# Tutorial

Nice work getting your editor up. In this little tutorial, we're going to create a tiny novel and publish it to a single markdown file.

## The application window

First, let's get a handle on what we're staring at here. As you can see, the Draftman2 app window is split into 2 panes. The top pane is called the Keeper. The bottom pane shows notes associated with items selected in the Keeper, both files and folders.

### The Keeper

The keeper consists of rows that represent items in your writing project, both files and folders. Folders can contain other folders and files. Files can contain other files. The Keeper is linear. Imagine your writing project as a single file. Items at the top of the Keeper represent things that would appear at the top of your file. Items at the bottom represent things that would appear at th end of the document.

Tip: if you create a new folder and name it 'Trash' Draftman2 will give it a special trashcan icon.

You can learn more about the Keeper by taking a look at the [docs on GitHub](#).

### Notes

Every item in Draftman2 has an associated notes file, which is displayed below the Keeper when you select an item. You don't need to save your notes. Draftman2 handles this automatically whenever you change your selection.

Notes provides only rudimentary text-editing capabilities, e.g. cut and paste, copying, etc., and remains internal to your project.

## Add a chapter

Now that we've got a good handle on the application window, let's create our simple novel.

First, add a folder to represent our first chapter to the root folder by:

1. Right-clicking in the whitespace below the Keeper rows (which should deselect
   any selected rows) and selecting _Add folder..._ from the popup  menu, or
2. Selecting _Add root folder..._ from the _Project_ menu.

Type 'Chapter 1' into the dialog and click _OK_. Draftman2 created a new folder and automatically marked as an object to include in the compilation by clicking the _Inc_ checkbox (short for Include).

## Add a scene to Chaper 1

Next, let's add a 'scene' to Chapter 1. In Draftman2 parlance, a 'scene' is either a file with no Markdown headings (#) or a count of all Markdown headings in a file.

To add a scene to Chaper 1:

1. Right-click on the Chaper 1 row and select _Add file..._ from the popup menu, or
2. Select the Chaper 1 row and then select _Add file..._ from the _Project_ menu.

Type 'Scene 1' into the dialog and click _OK_. Draftman2 created a new file item inside the Chapter 1 folder. To see it, click the _Expand all_ button beneath the Keeper. You can also click the arrow next to the Chaper 1 folder icon.

### Editing Scene 1 and 2

To edit our new scene, open it by:

1. Right-clicking on the Scene 1 row and selecting _Edit..._ from the popup menu, or
2. Double-clicking anywhere in the Scene 1 row _except the Name field_. If you double click the _Name_ field, you can rename the file.

Paste this text into the scene using your editor and close it.

```

Pellentesque suscipit urna quam, a mollis lacus cursus quis. Duis eu dui vel odio cursus venenatis vitae id dui. Mauris facilisis diam vel orci pellentesque posuere. Donec aliquam rhoncus nisl sed malesuada. Cras vel suscipit eros. Sed laoreet imperdiet ipsum, eget volutpat massa maximus sit amet. Duis vulputate rutrum metus, a fringilla purus placerat at. Aliquam egestas pretium efficitur. 
```

### Updating the word and scene counts

Since we've edited a file outside of Draftman2, we need to update the word and scene counts in the Keeper. Do that by clicking the _Update counts_ button beneath the Keeper.

Repeat this process to add another scene named 'Scene 2' to the Chaper 1 folder. After you've done that, repeat the same procedure for adding 'Chapter 2'.

You'll have to click and drag the Chapter 2 folder so that it appears just above the 'Start Here' file. Alas, in GTK applications, this can be a bit fiddly. The trick is to pay careful attention to the lines that appear above, below, and surrounding items. If you see 2 lines surrounding an item while clicking and dragging a row, it means GTK will place the row inside what's surrounded.
