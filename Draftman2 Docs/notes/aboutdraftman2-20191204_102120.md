# Welcome to Draftman2

Draftman2 is a draft-management system I created to manage writing long-form fiction. I wanted to create something markdown-based, minimalist, and that let me choose my own text editor.

Since you're already here, let's just jump right in and talk about notes.

## Draftman2 notes

Every Draftman2 object, i.e. files and folders, has an associated note. Notes are Markdown files saved in the 'notes' directory inside Draftman2 projects.

Why you might like this feature:

1. If you're a plotter, you can create a bunch of chapter folders and empty scenes and use the notes to keep track of what each scene or chapter is about.
2. As you're writing a scene, use a note to jot down problems or ideas you might think of as you're writing.
3. Use notes to keep track of what needs editing as you're proofing or going over your story.

Note files are saved automatically whenever you change a selection or quit Draftman2.

Okay, enough about notes. Let's now try opening the 'About Draftman2' file. To do that, you can either:

1. Double click anywhere other than the Name column in a file's row.
2. Right click in a file's row and select 'Edit...'
3. Select a row and then select 'Project->Edit...' from the menu.
