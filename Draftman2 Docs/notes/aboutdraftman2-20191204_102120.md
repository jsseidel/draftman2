# Welcome to Draftman2

Draftman2 is a draft-management system I created to manage writing long-form fiction. I wanted to create something markdown-based, minimalist, and that let me choose my own text editor.

Since you're already here, let's just jump right in and talk about notes.

To a file, you can either:

1. Double click anywhere other than the Name column in a file's row.
2. Right click in a file's row and select 'Edit...'
3. Select a row and then select 'Project->Edit...' from the menu.
