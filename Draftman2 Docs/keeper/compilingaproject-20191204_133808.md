# Compiling a Project

To assemble all the relevant files into a coherent single Markdown document, select *Compile...* from the Project menu and then choose a location to store the file.

Draftman2 will include all files marked as 'Inc' from the Keeper.

## Include folder titles

In the *Project->Preferences...* dialog, select *Include folder titles* to tell Draftman2 to automatically include folder titles as in the output at the appropriate heading level. 

## Include file titles

Similarly, select *Include file titles* to tell Draftman2 to automatically include file titles in the output at the appropriate heading level.

## Include text with files

If you need to include some arbitrary text before each file, like a `* * *` scene separator, select *Include text with files* and type in your text next to the check box. If, for some reason, you don't want to include that text after the first heading, as in the case of scene separators, click *And skip first*.
