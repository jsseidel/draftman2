## HiDPI

The only elements in Draftman2 affected by HiDPI currently should be the icons associated with item types. Until a fix is put in place for this, you can control the size of these icons with an environment variable:

```
DRAFTMAN2_ICON_SIZE=48
```

Typically this line is added to the drafman2.desktop file, like:

```
Exec=DRAFTMAN2_ICON_SIZE=48 /opt/draftman2/draftman2
```

Then, copy the desktop file to your local directory:

```
cp /usr/share/applications/draftman2.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/.
```
